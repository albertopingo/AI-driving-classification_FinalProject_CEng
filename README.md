# LSTM Time Series Prediction Model

## Description
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for time series prediction using accelerometer and gyroscope data. The model is trained on datasets captured from various sources under different motion scenarios.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras

## Design
The project consists of Python scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and prediction. It utilizes the Keras library for implementing the LSTM model. Visualization of results can be integrated for a better understanding of the model's performance.

## Features
- Utilizes LSTM architecture for time series prediction.
- Handles data preprocessing including scaling.
- Allows comparison of predicted values with actual values.
- Supports training on multiple datasets.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that the dataset files are available in the specified paths or adjust the paths accordingly in the script.
3. Run the `main.py` script.
